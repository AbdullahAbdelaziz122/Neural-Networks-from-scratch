# Implementing Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository is an attempt to build neural networks from the ground up using Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of neural networks by implementing them without relying on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Scope

- **Current Focus**: Implementing a basic feedforward neural network with essential components such as weight initialization, forward propagation, activation functions, loss calculation, and backpropagation.  
- **Future Plans**: Expanding the repository to include implementations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other advanced architectures.

## Mathematical Foundation

This implementation is purely code-based and does not include in-depth mathematical explanations.
